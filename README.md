# GPX Parsing, Data Prep, & Analysis
<br>
Optimized for working with scan sampling data specifically for primatological purposes.

### Instructions

To run the algorithm, you will need both **GPXanalysis.py** and **dataprep.py** downloaded in your working directory.<br>
The GPX files to be analysed should be copied into this same directory, the scripts will create any additional required directories for data storage. You will need a Python environment, whether global (installed on your computer) or a virtual environment (recommended, see instructions in **Steps.md** or [here](https://github.com/frozenbanana97/documentation) for setting one up and troubleshooting), with the proper requirements from **requirements.txt** installed.<br><br>
Once everything is installed correctly, run **GPXanalysis.py** and follow the prompts, the analysed data will be exported to the folder **gpkgData** ready for use in GIS applications as well as the folder **csvDayFiles** in .csv format.
